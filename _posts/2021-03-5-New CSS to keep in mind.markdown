Hello everyone!

Hope this post will blow up your mind

- [Glassmorphism CSS](http://gestyy.com/et6jx5): If you'd like to use the frosted glass 2021 HYPE UI effect in user interfaces, It is a must to see

- [Animista](http://gestyy.com/et6liB): Create texts with CSS effects, pretty cool and HYPE

- [Tailwind CSS](http://gestyy.com/et6lIe): Cannot forget about Tailwind CSS... so low-level, it never encourages you to design the same site twice. Even with the same color palette and sizing scale, it's easy to build the same component with a completely different look in the next project

Hope you enjoyed,

Have a nice day!
