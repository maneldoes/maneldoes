Hello everyone!

Hope this post will blow up your mind

- [Glassmorphism CSS](http://gestyy.com/et6jx5): If you'd like to use the frosted glass 2021 HYPE UI effect in user interfaces, It is a must to see

- [Animista](http://gestyy.com/et6liB): Create texts with CSS effects, pretty cool and HYPE

- [Tailwind CSS](http://gestyy.com/et6lIe): Cannot forget about Tailwind CSS... so low-level, it never encourages you to design the same site twice. Even with the same color palette and sizing scale, it's easy to build the same component with a completely different look in the next project

- [Milligram](http://gestyy.com/et6z0Y): Milligram provides a minimal setup of styles for a fast and clean starting point. Just it! Only 2kb gzipped! It's not about a UI framework. Specially designed for better performance and higher productivity with fewer properties to reset resulting in cleaner code
Hope you enjoyed,

Have a nice day!
