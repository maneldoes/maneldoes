Hello everyone!

For the first time in my life I saw a software that I was looking forward when I was a kid... 

If you are a gamer, it solves all your problems. If you are bored, just connect and play on other computers without spending your own resources, you just need a keyboard or controller. Thousands of videogames of every kind is up to your fingertips, am I kidding? Take a look!

The only thing you need is to sign up, plug in a controller (recommendable) and look for the game you like, still in beta version, but it is 100% functional as far as I tried. Hope you like it!

Have a nice day!
