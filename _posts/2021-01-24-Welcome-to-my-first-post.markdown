Hello everyone and welcome to the blog! "MANELDOES" is a blog where I would like to post some interesting things to me: Free content, tools, software... overall IT atmosphere

Let me attach here some interesting links about what I saw these last few days...

* [Free blog template](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog-jekyll) -> Another blog template, simple and minimalist
* [Pluto TV streaming for free](http://gestyy.com/etT3kJ) -> Free chanels without registration, there is a potential client who is promoting it and it pays my attention about the design, what they offer for free, apparently without ads...
