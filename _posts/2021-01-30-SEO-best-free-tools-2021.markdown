Hello everyone! 

I was helping out a friend with some SEO utilities, and I think that maybe can be your interests

I am not too much into this world, but few people already told me that these tools are useful

* [Display purposes](http://gestyy.com/etIray) -> Relevant hashtags will appear here. Banned and spammy tags are filtered out. You could use these hashtags on – for example – popular image sharing app Instagram, with which this website is in no way affiliated
* [Google Trends](http://gestyy.com/etIrze) -> Size popular topics by region on time-line plot
* [Scraper Plugin](http://gestyy.com/etIrOk) -> Chrome web store plugin. Scrapper is a very simple (but limited) data mining extension for facilitating online research when you need to get data into spreadsheet form quickly. It is intended as an easy-to-use tool for intermediate to advanced users who are comfortable with XPath
* [Screaming Frog](http://gestyy.com/etIrJQ) -> SEO audits website crawler with analyser tools
* [Pixlr](http://gestyy.com/etIrBC) -> Online editor with hundred tools, really popular!
* [Google right results](http://gestyy.com/etItqs) -> Analyze if the website could generate good results
* [Canva](http://gestyy.com/etUWSD) -> Obviously one of the top softwares, and one of my favourite one

Thank you so much, hope you like it!
