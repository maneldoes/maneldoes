Hello everyone, I would like to show you some exciting and interesting series I am following nowadays: "Horror" series (not really scared but it entertained me for a while)...

* [Equinox](http://gestyy.com/etY4aO) -> Follows a woman named Astrid whose sister (Ida) and 20 of her classmates go missing one day while on a graduation field trip. This all happens years ago when they were children. Three of the teens end up returning, but 18 are seemingly gone forever
* [Two sentence horror stories](http://gestyy.com/etY4f7) -> The first season consists of nine 30-minute episodes, each of which has a self-contained plot and characters. The series began as a series of five short films before it was adapted by The CW as a regular series
* [Dark](http://gestyy.com/etY4nu) -> Series about factions of people, most of whom are related to one another through generations of small-town links, fighting for control of time travel. In the town of Winden, Germany, there are several families who are all interconnected thanks to a 33-year-cycle of trauma

Thank you so much, hope you like it!
