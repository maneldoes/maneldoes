Hello everyone!

I was in need to connect from my Macbook M1 to an Ubuntu on a MSI laptop, but was having a lot troubles, tried also VNC software, TeamViewer... but the only one that satisfy my need with success, It was Google Remote Desktop with some extra steps because of Ubuntu issues. I attached the tutorial:

[Tutorial GRD](https://kifarunix.com/install-and-setup-chrome-remote-desktop-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

In few words I was not able to connect via Google remote desktop because of the Gnome desktop, had to install LXDE. Now I am able to connect to, but with other desktop appearance. I recommend to use the software for MacOS "Google remote desktop" instead of the web interface from Google Chrome. Hope it was useful!

Have a nice day!
