Hello everyone!

Hope you are fine ;)

I would like to explain you the way I am posting for example my new applications for phone

- [Hootsuite](http://gestyy.com/etBNVD): Actually I discovered this one and I really like it so much, for example to post everyday the same you have to duplicate it, which I really don't like but for free you can post up to 30 posts per week

- [Dlvrit](http://gestyy.com/etBN72): This one I expected It was what I was looking for, but at the end needs to work on it...

Hope it was useful to you, cannot remember the other tools I tried for this purpose, but wasn't useful to me

Have a nice day!
